# ☕ Urban Coffee Chain Analysis

📌 Overview
This project simulates the operations of a fictional Urban Coffee Chain, focusing on customer behavior, product performance, and loyalty program insights.
It demonstrates SQL data cleaning, and analysis using realistic, messy datasets — designed to showcase recruiter‑friendly portfolio skills.

- Customers: first_name, last_name, email, phone and join_date
- Products: product_name, category, price and stock_quantity
- Orders & Order_Items: transaction details, order_date, store_status
